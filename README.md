# Dynamic selection boxes in Javascript
This is a library to help easily set-up dynamic select-boxes. A dynamic select-box's choices depend on the value of another select-box. This helps you configure these boxes using simple Javascript objects. It is client-side, so your boxes will work without reloading the browser.
<br/>
### Installation
The library is currently in very early development, so many features may not function as expected or even not work at all.
<br/>
There will be a jsdelivr link when enough features are done, and bug-free.
